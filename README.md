# Employee Payroll-Tracker

Week 3 Challenge - Create a blog site that will dynamically add and post blog content.

## Description

The purpose of this project was to create a blog website that would utilize local storage to dynamically populate blog posts. I created this project to further understand and implement JavaScript in a realistic application. Through this project I have learned the methods of storing and retrieving objects from local storage as well as looping through arrays of objects. I have also gained a higher level of comfort working across all 3 of the languages we have currently used.
